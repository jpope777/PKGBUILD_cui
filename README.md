####Cower Update Interactive (CUI)

This is a small wrapper for cower so my lazy ass can update installed AUR packages with a click. This script is KDE dependent as it potentially uses Dolphin, Kate, KDialog, ...

Hoping to make it more robust in the future.

Currently only keeping this on github as it's more for personal use. If there is interest (especially if I make this crappy script better), I can upload to the AUR.
